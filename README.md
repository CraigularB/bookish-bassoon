# Bookshelf Pi
This is a Hackathon project to create a digital bookshelf running on a Raspberry Pi

It scrapes my Goodreads profile and downloads/caches up to the 100 most recently read books on my profile.

It then displays the images starting with most recent, rotating through all of them

The repo name was auto-suggested by Github and seemed to oddly fit my project
